## YARG v0.13.2 and current roadmap

YARG v0.13.2 is a minor update that fixes the Riffmaster crash and adds support for venues downloaded from the launcher.

The plan was to release v0.14 around this time, but external events conspired to delay work on the release, so we made the decision to go ahead and release v0.13.2 so we could at least get the Riffmaster fix in everyone's hands. With any luck, significant work towards 0.14 will be resuming shortly and we'll be able to get that released in the next month or so.

Happy holidays!
