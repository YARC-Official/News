After several months of hard work from the contributors and me, the beta version of v0.13 is finally being pushed onto nightly for testing! Here are the changes so far:

* **Pro Keys!**
    * That's right, they're finally here
    * Trill lanes are not yet implemented
* **Lots of engine reworks!**
  * **General**
    * Refactored sustain code to be shared between all engine types, instead of just guitar
    * Added sustain drop leniency
    * Countdowns on sections without notes
    * Reworked star power gain and drain to be deterministic (with help from mdsitton)
    * Altered how multiplier is applied to scoring to fix issues with percentage scoring ยน
    * Track many more stats
    * Fix solos not displaying in practice if the whole solo is not selected
  * **Vocals**
    * Vocal percussion support
    * Redid starpower detection to prevent accidental activations
    * Added option to disable noise-based starpower activation
    * ยน Fixed various scoring issues
    * Bring back alternative needle textures
    * Added note guidelines to vocal highway
  * **Drums**
    * Ghost and accent note support (models not finished yet)
    * Drum Hit SFX
  * **Guitar**
    * Implemented proper support for Open Chords
    * Allow Tap flag to be applied to Open Notes
    * Slight fixes to HOPO/Tap strumming, still needs work
    * Drop all held sustains when a new note is hit (if it is not an extended sustain)
        * This fixes holding multiple sustains of the same fret at once
    *  Rewrote extended sustain logic
* Add display for upcoming phrase in lyric bar
* Make sustain lines glow if the color is dark enough
* Various audio fixes
* Automatically reduce note speed on lower difficulties (can be disabled)
* Added option to dim background
* Sorted profiles list
* Updated replay read/write code and format
    * Old replays are not watchable in v0.13. From now on replays made on an older "engine version" will be invalidated
* Added a new "Experimental Settings" tab to the Settings menu
    * Features in this menu tend to be unfinished or very broken, use at your own discretion
* Reintroduced Guitar Whammy FX under Experimental Settings
    * Whammy FX is known to cause desync issues for many users, so it is disabled by default
* Numerous scanning fixes and performance improvements
* Fixes and optimizations to chart parsing

Starting with this nightly version, save data on nightly and stable will be separate, unlike before where save data was shared. This is because the nightly version of the game is quite a bit more unstable than before which could lead to corrupted save data.

Have fun! If you encounter any bugs, please report it to us as soon as possible.
