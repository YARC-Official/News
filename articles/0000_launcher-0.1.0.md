That's right, it's here! It's beautiful, isn't it?

That being said, the YARC Launcher is still in beta. There are still things that need to be polished, and still things that need to be added, but in its current state, everything essential is in! Downloading YARG, downloading the **official YARG setlist**, updating YARG, updating the setlist, and updating the launcher itself. 

If you have any problems, please feel free to join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r) and let us know. If there are any "launcher-breaking" bugs, we'll be sure to address it as soon as possible.

**HUGE** thanks to Pantotone and Kadu for helping me get this up and running. I could not have done it without them.

Thanks for all of your patience!

Don't stop YARGin'.
