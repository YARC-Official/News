After 4 or 5 months, the new engine is basically *almost* done. We just need a few more bug fixes, some more polishing, and the guitar engine to be consistent in replays in order to push v0.12.0 out onto stable. Every other gamemode (except for protar) has been reimplemented, along with most other features. That's crazy.

I cannot thank all of the contributors enough, I could not do this without them. I'd especially like to thank Riley The Fox, TheNathannator, and sonicfind, for their efforts in making this possible. And also Kadu for his amazing art as always.

The latest launcher update removed the "New Engine" tab, and the v0.12 version of the game has moved onto nightly with twice-a-day builds! Have fun!
