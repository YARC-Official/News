## Important Security Update

A **[security issue](https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01) in Unity 
requires action on your part**.

When running older versions of YARG, an attacker can use the Unity Player to 
read files and execute code as your user. To protect yourself, please ensure 
that you are running at least YARG Stable **v0.13.1** or Nightly **b3214** or 
higher. These and all newer versions are built with a newer version of Unity
which is not vulnerable to this security issue.

We will not be removing older versions from GitHub, but if you 
choose to run them it will be **at your own risk**. 


There is presently no known exploitation of this vulnerability, but it is 
better to be safe than sorry, so please update.

### Portable Releases
If you have previously manually installed a portable release or other build, 
ensure that it is updated or deleted. You do not have to intentionally run 
the game for this bug to be exploited.
