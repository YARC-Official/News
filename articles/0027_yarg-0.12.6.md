v0.12.6 of YARG has released! This is a very small update that adds support for the YARC Launcher v1.0.0 Beta!

Changelog:

* Fix MadCatz Xbox One drumkits not being recognized
* Tweak threshold for the yellow FPS icon to 90% refresh rate
* Fix issues with PlasticBand variant device notifications
* Allow setting setlist download location from command line arguments

Huge thanks to all of the contributors; YARG would not be possible without them!
