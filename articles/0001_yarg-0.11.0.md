   * Thank you SO MUCH to @kaduwaengertner and @Pantotone for helping me with it!
 * The Official YARG Setlist is ALSO HERE! Download it in the launcher!
   * The setlist will be regularly updated by the amazing charting team! Thank you so much to them! 
 * Customizable lyric bar

**Minor Changes:**
 
 * Vocal scoring now accounts for song speed
 * Removed problematic kick particles
 * Made source icons less pixelated
 * Show source icon in Discord RP
 * Fix `dev` being behind `master`
 * Adjusted models scaling
 * Properly fix solos, and fix Pro Drums/5-lane drums SP/solos/activations not showing up

Thank you **so much** to everyone who worked on this update! All of your contributions continue to make the game better, and better.
