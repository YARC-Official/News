v0.12.2 of YARG has released! This is a minor update with a ton of bug fixes, QOL features, and performance improvements!

**WARNING:** You may need to recalibrate your game after this update!

Changelog:

* **"YARG on Fire" Theme**
  * This was originally an April fools joke, but people liked it so we'll keep it for now
* **Audio Back-End Rework**
  * Thanks to sonicfind!
  * Audio loading speed improvements
  * Allow multiple audio sources to be active at one time: provides a more appealing fade between songs in the music library menu
  * Event-based stem volume control: niche, but allows live-sliding of stem volumes to effect the music player
  * Enhanced gameplay stem muting functionality: firstly, we now more properly implement a collective muting system - where a stem will only fully mute if *all* players with the stem are in a "miss" state (only partially muting otherwise). Secondly, this behavior can also apply to the background stem, if present. However, background stem mutes are normalized to a minimum of 50% volume - applied on top of the stem's volume setting. This is to ensure players can still hear some sort of audio at all times (unless your entire band has skill issues). This is accompanied with an altered settings entry for "Mute on Miss", where an additional option to ignore background stems for muting was added.
  * When the time comes, the system should be able to support swapping the audio library in-game (for example, if we add an ASIO option)
  * Addressed some inaccuracies with the calibrator (alongside taking device latency into account to produce lower values)
  * Fixed the momentary volume boost of the music player on startup
  * Fixed broken stem muting implementation (which is why it's also a "new feature")
  * Fixed preview audio start-end boundaries
  * Fixed some incorrect practice mode audio behavior
* **Music Library Improvements**
  * Added (toggleable) favorite button on songs, along with a "Playlists" menu to view your favorited songs!
  * Added options for showing stars or the high score in the music library
  * You can now click on the "Recommended Songs" header to refresh them
  * Search bar improvements
  * The sort setting in the music library is now saved across sessions
  * Improved performance when scrolling through the music library
* **Lighting Peripheral Improvements**
  * Fog events are now automatically generated if they don't exist in a chart
  * Added DMX cue change channel
  * Fixed SACN settings not loading correctly on game start
  * Fixed various lighting and stagekit bugs
* **Toast/Notification Improvements**
  * Multiple toasts will now be able to show up at once
  * You can now click on toasts to dismiss them
  * Toasts now become transparent when you hover over them, so you can see what's behind them
* Vocal engine presets
* New logging system (the log file location has moved!)
* Added some song scanning options
* Improved kick note shader to make it brighter and more saturated
* Added button to go to currently-playing song in the music player
* Added options to pause the game on window focus loss and controller disconnect
* Added option to disable/lessen highway starpower effects
* Added button to show scanning errors
* Added option for Starpower SFX to only be enabled on multi-track songs
* Fixed the hit window in practice mode not scaling correctly in some cases
* Fixed sustains animating very quickly at very slow song speed (and vice versa)
* Fixed the last note of a practice section not being included if it is not a sustain
* Disable inputs while songs are scanning
* Updated to Unity 2021.3.36f1
* Exiting the calibration menu or a replay now sends you back to the correct spot
* Various hit window display fixes
* The game can now be resized in windowed mode
* Drums now show the correct colors when in lefty-flip mode
* Fixed the drums color profile preview not using the correct colors for cymbals
* Fixed `.chart` disco flip events not working
* Fixed regular text events on vocals being parsed as lyrics
* Fixed the first section selected in practice mode not working correctly
* Make all textboxes disable navigation when selected
* Reworked loading screen management
* Make settings/content loading a bit more robust

Huge thanks to all of the contributors; YARG would not be possible without them!
