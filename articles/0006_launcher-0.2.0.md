YARC Launcher v0.2.0 has been released a few days ago! This update introduces the following features, and also fixes some bugs:
 
 * New YARG launch page!
 * Prevent user from selecting non-empty folders.
 * Error logging.
 * Different badge colors per article type.
 * Don't load all news articles at once.
 * ACTUALLY finally fixed YARC Launcher auto-update.

Along with this, v0.1.3 came out a few weeks ago which:
 
 * Fixed Linux launcher permissions on YARG download.
 * Added support for a video in a news article.
 * Switched to .msi installer to hopefully solve more antivirus problems.

*Both* of these updates required a manual reinstall, so I apologize for the inconveniences that may have caused! Have a good day.
