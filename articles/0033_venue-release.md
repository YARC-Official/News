# Venues

We are pleased to announce that **venue event tracks in charts are now completely supported in the Nightly release!** Stage lighting, camera angles, and animations (except for lip sync, which will be implemented over the next few months) are now operational.

Additionally, **the entire setlist now has venues implemented!** Update the setlist and enjoy the experience of playing with the band.

# Launcher Update

To bring venues to everyone, **the launcher has been updated to include venues**, created by the community! We have curated a collection of stages and visualizers, and will continue to add more venues as the community creates more of them. Also, DLC and YARN releases are now in separate sections; more updates for chart downloads are coming in the near future.

Keep in mind that while venue functionality is now implemented, the venues, assets, and characters are still largely in the demo stage. In this next stage of development with venues, we’d like your help with making venues and character models! To assist with informing the use of assets, we’ve created this [asset sourcing guideline document](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/143t_h-MzHxfdUkum2ljxljt8gbM44kawK5bhC2qT0jE/edit?usp=sharing>) for your reference. **Discuss venue creation in the venue-artists channel, and further venue development in venue-dev channel.** Please spread the news to your friends or other communities: together, we can add more venues, more characters, and more polish to animation!
