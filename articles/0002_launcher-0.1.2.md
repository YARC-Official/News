YARC Launcher v0.1.1 and v0.1.2 have been released since the official release on the launcher this afternoon. These updates address the issues below:
 
 * Fixed links in news panel
 * Changed title to "YARC Launcher" instead of "YAL"
 * YARG on linux now launches from "YARG.x86_64" instead of just "YARG"
 * Stopped using GitHub gists to (hopefully) stop false malware detections by various anti-viruses.

Apologies for the inconviences! Have a good day.
