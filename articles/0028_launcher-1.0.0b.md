Yup, that's right, I rewrote the entire launcher. This time around, I took all of the *invaluable* feedback we've received about the launcher (thank y'all!), so much so that I feel like this should be the full official v1.0 of the launcher. Changes include:

* **Onboarding**
  * You'll now be greeting with an onboarding screen when first opening the launcher.
  * Here you can select your installation path, and also choose what components you'd like to download!
* **Marketplace**
  * The marketplace is where you can add additional content to your library (all for free)
  * This content includes **a preview to the first YARG setlist DLC! (exclusive to the launcher beta)**
* **Profiles**
  * The profile system has been revamped so you can have multiple instances of the same application.
  * This way you can modify profile settings individually (that's right).
  * You can now change the display name, add custom arguments, and select the version of each profile.
  * This means you can now play older versions of YARG, right from the launcher!
* **Brand New UI**
  * Implemented Kadu's incredible new UI concept for the launcher.
  * Some parts are still missing, but they'll be added to the launcher within the new few updates.
* ...and more!

The beta version of the launcher is missing some features however. These will be added in the full release version:

* You can not yet change the installation path after you first selected it.
* Some important information about setlists (songs, length, credits, etc.) is still not present.
* ...and some more things.

You must download the beta version of the launcher manually from it's GitHub page. Once the full v1.0.0 release comes out, it'll prompt you to update the launcher. From there, you can use it as normal.

Please let us know if you encounter any issues (especially if you're on a non-windows platform) or have feedback!
