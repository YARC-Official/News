That's right it's here. This article is a *little* late to the party, but I thought I'd let you all know that **the YARG New Engine Alpha is here!** These test builds can be accessed on the left side of the launcher, where it says "new engine," and will be updated semi-often before the builds can be accessed in stable!

So far, these builds have some very important features such as:
 * Practice mode
 * Replays (still in beta at the time of this article's release)
 * Frame-independent hit detection (you no longer have to run at 1000 fps!)
 * A new *extremely* fast scanning system

Please do keep in mind that **this is in ALPHA!** There are still *many* missing and incomplete features.

**HUGE** thanks to Riley the Fox, TheNathannator, sonicfind, and some others for all of their amazing contributions to the new engine. All of your help is much appericated.  

Stay tuned for new patches! Keep YARGin'.
