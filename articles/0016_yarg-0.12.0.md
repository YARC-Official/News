YARG v0.12.0 has released! The game has been entirely rewritten since v0.11 and many systems and UIs have been redesigned. We have tried to list as many of the changes as we can here, but after 8 months of development it is quite hard to remember everything! Plus, the game is pretty much entirely different so bugs that may have existed in v0.11 were "fixed" just by redesigning the entire game.

**Full Patch Notes:**
