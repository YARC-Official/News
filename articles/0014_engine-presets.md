Engine presets are available for use in the newest nightly build!

Engine presets allow you to change basic properties of the engine such as the hit window size, various leniencies such as strum leniencies, and also toggle features such as anti-ghosting and infinite front-end. They work for guitar and drums only.

You can create custom presets in the Settings menu in the Customization tab, and export them for your friends to use! YARG also comes with some basic presets of its own: **Default** (duh), **Casual**, and **Precision**.

Here are the settings for those presets, **as of the time of this article releasing**. These will most likely change over time:

**Default:**

* Anti-ghosting†: on
* Infinite front-end†: off
* HOPO leniency†: 80ms
* Strum leniency†: 60ms
* Strum leniency (no notes)†: 25ms
* Dynamic hit window: off
* Hit window size: 150ms

**Casual:**

* *Same as default with the following changes*:
* Anti-ghosting†: off
* Infinite front-end†: on
* Strum leniency†: 70ms
* Strum leniency (no notes)†: 30ms

**Precision:**

* *Same as default with the following changes*:
* Strum leniency†: 50ms
* Strum leniency (no notes)†: 20ms
* Dynamic hit window: on
* Hit window max size: 130ms
* Hit window min size: 40ms

(Everything with a † only applys to guitar)

We've also added preset indicators that can be seen here:

These are also likely temporary, and will also change with time.

Have fun!
