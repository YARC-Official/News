The circle theme is available for use the newest nightly build!

The theme is not 100% complete yet, and there are some elements missing such as sustain animations/particles. These will be added in the upcoming days, however, we wanted to get your feedback first!

The theme is only available for Five Fret Guitar at the moment, however, we will expand it with drums later on as well.

Have fun!
