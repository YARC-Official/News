After just over a year since the last stable update we present YARG v0.13.0!

If anyone finds any bugs, please report it as soon as possible! grishhung, Hubbubble, the new maintainer wyrdough, and the new Setlist Manager frickitickitavi, together with the rest of the contributors, **will continue to release updates to YARG!**

Unfortunately, there are some features that we've promised in the past which couldn't make it into this update (such as pro guitar), which we sincerely apologize about.
